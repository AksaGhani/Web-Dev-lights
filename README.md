### **Application Fact Sheet:**
 The application is very simple to use and contains features to make navigation within the website easier for the user. The aim of this project is to act as a sample web application where the user is able to visit the four main pages: Home, About, Game and Legend.

#### How does the Application work?
 The home page contains a brief explantion as to what the project is and contains my contact information. This page acts as welcome page and introduces the application, it has all the features such as navigation bar and sidebar to allow the user to click onto other pages within the application.

 When the ABOUT button is clicked the user is redirected to the About page, where there is in depth information about me, including my levels of experience in coding languages(c# and Javascript). The About page includes my past education up till now. 

#### **Game Features:**
 Next to the About button you will find the GAME button, the redirected page will be where the game itslef is located. The main features on this page include the images of light-bulbs which are clickable, as well as the GO, SUBMIT and RESET buttons. The aim of the Game is that the player presses GO, which in turn will present a light sequence in the SMB lab. Once the lights have all turned off the player must click on the correct coloured light-bulbs provided in order to turn the light on the lights in the correct sequence. The player must then click the SUBMIT button in order to see whether they have got it correct or not.

 I have also added a warning section to the Game page as it is important to ensure that no harm comes to any of the users whilst playing the game. For example, the warning is for people who may suffer from photosensitive epilepsy, which suggests that epileptic fits may be caused through flashing lights and colours.

#### Key Features of the Web Application:
 1. The Legend Page
##### This page is a very important asset to the web application as it explains how the player must play the game, giving a key of what all of the elements within the page mean. 

 2. The Buttons 
##### Each page has a similar layout with buttons to act as a navigation bar such as the 'Home' Button, without this functionality the application would not have access to other pages. Below is a screenshot of the buttons and how I have laid them out at the top of the page, this structure is replicated throughout the application.

3. The Footer
##### The footer contains all of my contact details, and allows the user to have access to all of my contact information from any page within the application. However, I have only added the icons to indicate that the socials can be found on the home page.  

4. The SideBar / Menu
##### The sidebar is accessible to all pages apart from the About page as I felt it was not needed there. But this feature allows the user to have more than one navigation system to get around the website. The buttons at the top also act as navigation and have been placed there in case not all platforms or screens may not fit the sidebar on.

### Testing in Different Browsers
The two browsers I chose to test my web application in were Chrome (as shown in all previous screenshots), but to ensure that my website was compatible with more than one browser I then went ahead and checked what my website looked like in Edge.

As you can see when the website was opened in Edge, the results were the same as when it was opened in Chrome. I was very pleased with the outcome, as it suggested that there were no bugs which may have needed my attention in order to fix them.

### Testing Web Accessibility 
I have done research on web accessibility and using the following resources: 
[https://www.w3.org/WAI/] 
[https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/web-accessibility]
[https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2018/12/accessibility-features-in-webstorm-2018-3/]
I was able to come up with a good understanding of what Web Accessibility is as a concept. In order to check My website's current web accessibility I could use the Free 508 Checker:
[http://www.508checker.com/] 
However, in order for this to work you would need to have a website which is up and running, therefore, I was unable to test the web accesibility of my application as it is still in the creation stage.
