### **Application Fact Sheet:**
##### The application is very simple to use and contains features to make navigation within the website easier for the user. The aim of this project is to act as a sample web application where the user is able to visit the four main pages: Home, About, Game and Legend.

##### 4. The SideBar / Menu
###### The sidebar is accessible to all pages apart from the About page as I felt it was not needed there. But this feature allows the user to have more than one navigation system to get around the website. The buttons at the top also act as navigation and have been placed there in case not all platforms or screens may not fit the sidebar on.
